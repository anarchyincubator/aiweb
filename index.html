      <h2>Be the Hero we Need</h2>
      <p>It's time to directly build apps to directly help people with their most important needs - like food, housing, and healthcare. Instead of letting profits drive our app infrastructure, lets focus on, from the bottom-up, empowering communities with the tools they need to thrive together.</p>

      <h3>Our Approach</h3>
      <p>We are building open source, community driven, location based apps to connect communities with the goods and services they need.  For example, Eggslist is our already-built platform to connect local food producers (like gardeners, homesteaders, and farmers) directly to people in their community.<br>
      <br>Our platforms function like a user-experience friendly Craigslist - enter your zip and search categories and subcategories of items or services near you, with easily editable categories to meet needs.<br><br></p>
      <p>Our platforms are free, able to be self-hosted and deployed anywhere, and easily  modified for different uses. Deploy your own community food network, a support network to help people meet each other's needs during natural disasters, or create a digital mutual aid network in your city.</p>

      <h3>Be Part of a Compassionate Developer Community</h3>
